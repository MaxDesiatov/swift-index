# swift-index

> Centralized package index utilities for [SwiftPM](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager).

The idea behind swift-index is even centralized indices can be decentralized. This repo provides the necessary code to create a swift-index compatible server, which can in turn just be a proxy to another index. Then, users will opt-in to particular centralized indices in their `Package.swift` manifest file.
